            Welcome! PokeBin was created as an alternative to PokePaste. As a
            developer, I did this with three ideas in mind:
            <br />

          <ol class="ml-10">
            <li>
              I'm passionate about Pokemon and the community! I'm always looking
              for ways to help others grow and enjoy the game!
            </li>
            <li>
              I sensed that the PokePaste project is in an archived state with
              little activity and no response to pull requests.
            </li>
            <li>
              I've been in contact with others who play and appreciate Pokemon
              and are helping me (suggestions, ideas, and support) to build a
              new and valuable community!
            </li>
