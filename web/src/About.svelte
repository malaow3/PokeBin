		<p class="text-lg mb-4">
			PokeBin was created as an alternative to PokePaste. As a developer,
			I did this for three reasons
			<br />
		</p>
		<ul class="ml-10">
			<li>I wanted to publish an actual web app</li>
			<li>
				To me, it seemed like the PokePaste project is in an archived
				state
			</li>
			<li>
				I felt like there were some changes I could make that would be
				beneficial
			</li>
		</ul>

		<br />
		<p class="text-lg mb-4">
			If you come across any bugs, feel free to make an issue on <a
				href="https://github.com/malaow3/PokeBin/issues"
				target="_blank">GitHub</a

		<br />
		This is entirely a passion-project, but once again I want to thank you for
		checking out <span class="text-pink-600">Poke</span><span
