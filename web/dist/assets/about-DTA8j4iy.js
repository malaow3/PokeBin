PokeBin was created as an alternative to PokePaste. As a developer, I did this with three ideas in mind:<br></p><ol class=ml-10><li>I'm passionate about Pokemon and the community! I'm always looking for ways to help others grow and enjoy the game!</li><li>I sensed that the PokePaste project is in an archived state with little activity and no response to pull requests.</li><li>I've been in contact with others who play and appreciate Pokemon and are helping me (suggestions, ideas, and support) to build a new and valuable community!</li></ol><br><p class>As always, if you come across any bugs, kindly notify me through <a href=https://github.com/malaow3/PokeBin/issues class=text-sky-500 rel=noreferrer target=_blank>GitHub</a> - your ideas are always welcome and thanks again for checking out PokeBin!</p><p class>Feel free to also take a look at our <a href=/tos class=text-sky-500 rel=noreferrer target=_blank>Terms of Use</a>!</p><br><br><p>As you can appreciate, hosting a site isn't free!
