## What is PokeBin?
PokeBin is a portmanteau of "Pokemon" and "Pastebin". More generally, it's a website that aims
to allow you to share Pokemon spreads & sets with anyone. This is essentially a fork of [Pokepaste](https://github.com/felixphew/pokepaste)
with some minor updates!


## How the sausage is made
PokeBin is composed of a few components:
- Relevant Pokemon data
- A web server (backend)
- A web client (frontend)
- A database

### Relevant Pokemon data
There are a few pieces that are required to make PokeBin somewhat useful.

- Pokemon information (types, species, forms, move data). This information comes curtosey of [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/)
which is a wonderful project and I highly recommend you check them out!
- Pokemon images. Again, these come from [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/). There is a *slight* difference between this repo and 
the production version. That difference is the images are hosted in an S3 bucket from Amazon. This is only because when I tried to copy
all the images with Docker I ran out of disk space ðŸ˜­ whoops!
- Item information and sprites. This comes from [Pokemon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/). The data is in a JS file by default, so 
I put together a small script to convert it to JSON.

### Web server
The web server is built with Rust (using Axum). I just like writing Rust. Not much more to it!

### Web client
The web client is built with Svelte. I have never used Svelte before and this seemed 
like a great learning experience.

### Database
The database used is Postgres. When running locally, I spin it up with Docker. For Prod, it's a hosted database instance.


## How to use
First, make sure you have all the prerequisites completed.
- Basic understanding of Git / command line familiarity
- Rust installed
- Docker installed
- Your Javascript package manager of choice (for this example, I'll be using Bun)


If you want to run PokeBin localy, you'll need to follow the following steps:

1. Clone the repo
2. You will need to create a .env file. Inside that file you'll need to define two environment variables.
    - DATABASE_URL: The URL of the database. You can use a docker container and use the docker compose file to spin up the database. If you are using docker for example it will be "postgresql://malaow:postgres@localhost:5432/pokebin"
    - POKEBIN_KEY: A key to encrypt the IDs in the database.

For example your file might look like:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://malaow:postgres@localhost:5432/pokebin
POKEBIN_KEY=my_secret_key
```
3. Install the web dependencies by running `cd web; bun install`
4. Build the web files by running `bun run build`
5. Cd back to the root of the repo by running `cd ..`
6. Start the database. Run `docker compose up -d db`
7. Build the Rust binary by running `cargo build -r`

If you are on Linux, you can run the whole thing via docker. Just run `docker compose up -d`
If you **aren't** on Linux, that's fine. Just make sure the database is running, then run the web server with `./target/release/pokebin`

# Roadmap
There are a couple of "planned" features that I hope to add to PokeBin -- time permitting.

I'm going to excluded things like routine maitenance. I'll be adding new mons / items / etc. in the future as they come out.

- Accounts: associating pastes to an account so that they can be later reviewed without hoping you saved the link. Maybe there is a way to link a Showdown account? TBD.
    - This can also let a paste be deleted if it's requested by the owner of the paste.
- Import / Export from Showdown -- this obviously requires a change on Showdown's platform -- I am willing to make those contributions if this site gains enough traction.
- Native for mobile? Instead of a PWA or mobile-responsive website, building a native app could be pretty neat.
- Timed-deletion: You can mark a paste to be deleted after a specific amount of time.


# Contributing
I believe open source is one of the most amazing parts of software! Being able to contribute to a tool you use to make it better, fix a bug, or add a new feature is incredibly rewarding.
If you want to contribute, feel free to fork the repo and send a PR with your changes!

Unfortunately, there isn't a strict set of tests / linting guidelines. I might be a bit picky on a review, but over time I hope to get the repo to a state where 
contributing is easy and there is enough feedback baked into the tests/linting/static analysis that if things pass it should have no problem getting merged!
